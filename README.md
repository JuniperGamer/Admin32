# Admin32
Deletes System 32 with brute-forced admin permissions (hopefully) bypassing UAC. Useful on school networks.

Graphic_Admin32.batch gives a choice asking if you want to reset the graphic drivers, it runs the del system 32 code and then tries to reset the graphic drivers most likely killing everything :)
